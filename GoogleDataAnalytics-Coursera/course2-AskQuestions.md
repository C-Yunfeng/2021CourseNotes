### Week 1 Effective questions



#### Craft effective questions

- The more questions you ask，the more you'll learn about your data and the more powerful your insights will be at the end of the day.

- ineffective questions

  - leading question
  - closed-ended question 
    - can be answered by yes or no
  - Questions that are too vague and lack context

- effective questions(SMART)

  - time-bound 有时限的

  - if a question is too general, try to **narrow it down** by focusing on just one element. 缩小范围

  - measurable question

    - more specific and useful information
