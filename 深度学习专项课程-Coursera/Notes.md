### Neural Networks and Deep Learning

#### Introduction

deep learning is one of the most **highly sought after skills** in technology worlds. 炙手可热的技能

**gain and master** those skills

demystify some of that black magic 揭开黑魔法的神秘面纱

**get** your deep learning systems to work well 【使役动词】



**rectify** just means taking a max of 0 which is why you get a function shape like this.

So is this neighborhood **highly walkable**? 适合步行



There's been a lot of **hype** about neural networks.

This has been an incredibly **lucrative** application of neural networks at multiple companies. 赚钱的

**make huge strides** in the last several years 取得巨大进步

time series or **temporal sequence** 时间序列

complex **neural network architecture**

People are just really good at **interpreting** unstructured data. 解释

Computers are now much better at interpreting unstructured data as well **compared to just a few years ago**.

a lot of the techniques we'll go over will apply to **both** structured data and to unstructured data. 【我肯定想不到要加both】

create **tremendous** economic value 巨大的/very big/excellent

- 小数据和大数据上ML算法与DL算法的比较

- 有趣的是，许多算法创新关注的是让神经网络跑的更快。如讲sigmoid换成ReLU

Tech Data society is **throwing up** one more digital data or computation with the rise of hardware like GPUs. 抛出，如throw up a new question。one more表示“再一次”

let's **go on to** the last video. 接着



the **most important** **building blocks** of deep learning 最重要的组成部分【同义替换】

Perhaps some of you have **some ideas of where** you might want to apply deep learning yourself.

I hope you that way too. 我希望你也这样
